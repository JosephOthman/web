<h2> Hometown Hero : Cleveland Cavaliers (2003-2010) </h2>
  <p> When Lebron was drafted in 2003, he already had a plethora of expectations brought upon him. He was the number one overall pick for the Cavaliers, a team that had won just
    17 games the year prior. He was already known as "The Chosen One", and after just 3 years of playing for a bottom-feeder franchise, he had brought them to the playoffs. In
    2006, Lebron would make his playoff debut, and in 13 games would average 31 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists per game, including an incredible 45, 7 and 6 performance in a
    pivotal game 5 against the Wizards. His playoff run would be cut short by the Pistons in a 7 game series, but we were already introduced to many things that Lebron would
    become notable for in his illustrious career. First of all, no matter what the conditions were, if you wanted Lebron to be great for just a 7 game series, he would be able
    to do it. However, we also get hints to how his first tenure in Cleveland would end; no matter how good Lebron would play, Cleveland's management would never put a good
    enough team around him to completely triumph. His team would always have too many weaknesses to succeed in the playoffs, no matter how the regular season would go. Still,
    every year he would trick us into thinking otherwise, and would even reach the finals in 2007 off of quite possibly the greatest performance of his career: game 5 of the 2007
    Eastern Conference Finals, where he would end the game scoring Cleveland's final 25 points. He quite literally was the entire team that game. However, more of the same would
    ensue until 2010, where he was finally done with the Cavaliers' Management. After losing to the Celtics in the 2010 playoffs, Lebron was headed elsewhere. <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx4z_pCA_6k">Lebron's 2007 ECF Game 5 highlights: </a> </p>
<h2> The Decision : Miami Heat (2011-2014) </h2>
  <p> When Lebron decided to "take his talents to South Beach," shockwaves were sent throughout the entire NBA. Lebron would be teaming up with superstars Dwyane Wade and Chris
	Bosh to form the league's most hated team for years to come. Not only did they promise championships to Miami, but they bragged about how easy it would be in the offseason,
	before any of them had even played any games together. <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9BqUBYaHlM"> Their welcoming party can be found here</a>. This would come back to hurt them in 2011, as even though they made it to the NBA Finals, they seemed to choke against 
	a Dallas Mavericks team that no one thought even had a chance. Lebron himself was held to just 17 points per game during that series, including just 8 in a pivotal game 4.
	Lebron would come to be known as a choker, the man who wanted to be king without a ring, and that he needed a super team to get there in the first place. He responded in 2012
	making the playoffs in a lockout-shortened season, and coasting to the Eastern Conference Finals once again. There he would face Boston yet again, the team that claimed to get
	Lebron to quit a flee to Miami because he couldn't beat them alone. In Game 5 of that series, Paul Pierce hit a game-sealing dagger in Lebron's face to take a 3-2 lead, and 
	it looked like Miami were doomed to fail again. Lebron responded with one of the greatest performaces we've seen in history, scoring 45 points on 73% shooting, with 15 rebounds
	to go along with it. After another great performace to win game 7, they found themselves in the NBA Finals and won it in 5 games to finally secure Lebron James' first ring.
	However, whispers had already started that he could only win in a non-legit season, and that it wasn't a real ring. He responded with quite possibly the greatest individual
	season in history, only one vote away from the first unanimous MVP in league history. He brought his team back to the finals once again, where they would win in 7 behind his
	performance and one of the greatest shots in NBA history from Ray Allen in game 6. He had finally proven himself by any normal standards, but after losing the finals in 2014,
	the critics made even more noise. But by now, Lebron was done in Miami, and needed to return to Cleveland to bring one to the Land. </p>
<h2>Coming Home : Cleveland Cavaliers (2015-2018)</h2>
  <p> As soon as Lebron signed with Cleveland in the offseason, he promised a ring to the city. This Cavs team was very different than his previous one, with all-stars Kyrie
	Irving and Kevin Love to support him now. He brought the team to the finals (at this point his 5th in a row), but had to face the new juggernauts of the West in the Golden
	State Warriors. Love and Irving both got hurt earlier in the postseason and couldn't play in the finals, so it was up to Lebron and a weak supporting cast to get the job
	done for Cleveland. Although he gave it his all and had an incredible series, it wasn't enough, and he would now be 2-4 in the finals after this loss. He attempted to avenge
	this loss the next year, but that season it looked like the Warriors were invincible. They ended the year with 73 wins, a new record. All last year, everyone thought that if
	the Cavs were healthy, they would have won the series, but that looked improbable now. Still, the Cavaliers coasted to the finals once again, and would find themselves down 3-1
	in the series. Lebron would give another 3 legendary performances, including back to back 41 point games to bring them to game 7, where he would end up with the greatest block
	in NBA history. They would win game 7, becoming the only team to ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the NBA finals, and cementing Lebron's legacy on the Mount Rushmore of
	  Basketball. <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDCegwpnlbM">More on this can be found here </a>. The rest of his tenure would be much of the same as his first, as after losing Kyrie he would play incredible and make it to the finals twice more, just to lose to
	the Warriors with their new superstar in Kevin Durant. But with 3 rings already and possibly the greatest finals performance in history, Lebron had no more to prove. He could
	now leave for Los Angeles, after fulfilling his promise to Cleveland. </p>

<h2> Hometown Hero : Cleveland Cavaliers (2003-2010) </h2>
  <p> When LeBron was drafted in 2003, he already had a plethora of expectations brought upon him. He was the number one overall pick for the Cavaliers, a team that had won just
    17 games the year prior. He was already known as "The Chosen One", and after just 3 years of playing for a bottom-feeder franchise, he had brought them to the playoffs. In
    2006, LeBron would make his playoff debut, and in 13 games would average 31 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists per game, including an incredible 45, 7 and 6 performance in a
    pivotal game 5 against the Wizards. His playoff run would be cut short by the Pistons in a 7 game series, but we were already introduced to many things that LeBron would
    become notable for in his illustrious career. First of all, no matter what the conditions were, if you wanted LeBron to be great for just a 7 game series, he would be able
    to do it. However, we also get hints to how his first tenure in Cleveland would end; no matter how good LeBron would play, Cleveland's management would never put a good
    enough team around him to completely triumph. His team would always have too many weaknesses to succeed in the playoffs, no matter how the regular season would go. Still,
    every year he would trick us into thinking otherwise, and would even reach the finals in 2007 off of quite possibly the greatest performance of his career: game 5 of the 2007
    Eastern Conference Finals, where he would end the game scoring Cleveland's final 25 points. He quite literally was the entire team that game. However, more of the same would
    ensue until 2010, where he was finally done with the Cavaliers' Management. After losing to the Celtics in the 2010 playoffs, Lebron was headed elsewhere. </p>
